# AEMCS CDN Log Analysis Tooling

This repository helps to analyze the CDN logs of the AEM as a Cloud Service (AEMCS) environment using the [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/observability-cloud.html) or [ELK stack](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack). The analysis provides insights into the performance and security of your AEMCS implementation.

To quickstart the analysis Adobe provides pre-built dashboards for both Splunk and ELK stack. 

However, you can enhance and create additional dashboards to gain further insights and share them with the AEMCS community. Your contributions are welcome, please create a pull request and don't forget to review the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The following respective sections provide the necessary steps to get started with the analysis:

- [ELK stack](ELK/README.md)
- [Splunk](splunk/README.md)
